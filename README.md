# data-driven-koopman
Repository for my MSc project in the data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for a SDE, the method is based in the paper "Nonparametric uncertainty quantification for
stochastic gradient flow" by Tyrus Berry and John Harlim [Link](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/14097940X)

The main module is in `ko_estimation.py`
